          Black coffee is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped
          in hot water, served warm. And if you want to sound fancy, you can
          call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir. Since it isnâ€™t
          doctored up with milk or sugar, the quality of coffee is especially
          important.

        <p>
          As the most popular coffee drink out there, the latte is comprised of
          a shot of espresso and steamed milk with just a touch of foam. It can
          be ordered plain or with a flavor shot of anything from vanilla to
          pumpkin spice.

        <a href="#" class="cappuccino"><strong>Cappuccino</strong></a>
        <p>
          Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often
          with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can
          find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in
          flavor shot, as well.
